# speed-and-pothole-detection
In this projectr, we describe the combination of two different sensors to be able to measure the speed, if the car is over speeding and if there is a pothole on the road. For this we make use of an ultrasonic sensor to detect potholes, two infrared sensors to be able to detect the speed, a piezoelectric buzzer to alert the over speeding, and an Arduino UNO to be able to control de whole system.
